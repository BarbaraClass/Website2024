I am a researcher interested in among-individual differences in wild vertebrate populations. My work is at the intersection of behavioural ecology and evolutionary biology as I study questions related to animal personality, assortative mating, social behaviour, competition, and adaptation to urbanization. To do this I use a variety of mixed models, long-term data, and simulations.
