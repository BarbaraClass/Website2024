## About Me

I am a managing editor at Peer Community In (https://peercommunityin.org/), a non-profit organization that organizes the community-based & open evaluation of preprints and their publication in diamond open access (https://peercommunityjournal.org/). My work is based at the French National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and Environment, where I am part of the Open Science department.

Before that, I did a PhD and a few postdocs (in Finland, Australia, France, Germany) in behavioural ecology and evolutionary biology. Some of the topics I studied (and am still studying in my spare time) are among-individual variation (animal personality), assortative mating, social behaviour, competition, and adaptation to urbanization. To carry out this research, I use a variety of mixed models, long-term data from wild populations, and simulations.
