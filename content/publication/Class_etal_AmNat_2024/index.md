abstract: Social environments impose a number of constraints on individuals’ behavior. These constraints have been hypothesized to generate behavioral variation among individuals, social responsiveness, and within-individual behavioral consistency (also termed “predictability”). In particular, the social niche specialization hypothesis posits that higher levels of competition associated with higher population density should increase among-individual behavioral variation and individual predictability as a way to reduce conflicts. Being predictable should hence have fitness benefits in group-living animals. However, to date empirical studies of the fitness consequences of behavioral predictability remain scarce. In this study, we investigated the associations between social behavior, its predictability, and fitness in the eastern water dragon (Intellagama lesueurii), a wild gregarious lizard. Since this species is sexually dimorphic, we examined these patterns both between sexes and among individuals. Although females were more sociable than males, there was no evidence for sex differences in among-individual variation or predictability. However, females exhibited positive associations between social behavior, its predictability, and survival, while males exhibited only a positive association between mean social behavior and fitness. These findings hence partly support predictions from the social niche specialization hypothesis and suggest that the function of social predictability may be sex dependent.
