My Ph.D. thesis aimed to provide a quantitative genetics overview of personality in a wild population of blue tits (*Cyanistes caeruleus*). In the first part of my thesis, I showed that two behaviours measured during handling are heritable and under selection. The second part addressed the development of animal personality and heritable lifetime changes in behaviour. In the last part of my thesis, I developed a statistical approach to estimate assortative mating based on personality in wild populations.
