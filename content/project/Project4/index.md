My second postdoc on urban reptiles sparked my interest in assessing the adaptive responses of wildlife to anthropogenic changes. In February 2022, I joined Anne Charmantier's lab in Montpellier to study the impacts of urbanization on quantitative genetic variation. In particular, I have been investigatng the impacts of urbanization on the evolutionary potential of size in great tit (*Parus major*) fledglings. I have also been collaborating with Laura Gervais on a study testing for urbanization-related differences in behavioural variation. Two manuscripts are currently in preparation.
